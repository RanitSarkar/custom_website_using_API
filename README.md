# custom_website_using_API
Sign up for an OpenWeatherMap API key at https://openweathermap.org/.
Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' in the JavaScript code with your actual API key.
Save the HTML code in a file called index.html.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
The website will display a form where you can enter a location (e.g., "London, UK"). After submitting the form, it will fetch the current weather data for that location using the OpenWeatherMap API and display the location name, temperature, and weather description.

Please note that this is a basic example, and you can further enhance the website by adding more weather details, icons, styling, error handling, and additional API endpoints like forecast data.
